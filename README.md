# Parking-Management-System

---

### **1. Introduction**

Parking is a common problem in busy places like offices, malls, and universities. Many times, it becomes difficult to find empty spaces or to keep track of which cars have entered or left.

Our project, **“Parking System Management,”** is designed to solve these problems using a computer-based system. It will record car information, show empty parking spaces, calculate parking fees, and make the whole process faster and easier.

### **2. Objectives**

The main goals of our project are:

- **To manage vehicle entry and exit properly:**  
  The system will record when a vehicle enters and when it leaves. This helps in keeping track of parking usage.

- **To show available parking spaces quickly:**  
  The system will display how many slots are empty and available for new cars.

- **To calculate parking fees automatically:**  
  The system will count the total parking time and calculate the fee without manual work.

- **To keep records of vehicles safely:**  
  All vehicle data (vehicle number, time, and date) will be saved in files for future reference.

### **3. Features**

1. **Vehicle Entry/Exit Record:**  
   When a vehicle enters, the user can enter the car number, time, and date. When it exits, the system records the leaving time.

2. **Available Space Display:**  
   The system will show the total parking slots and how many are still free.

3. **Fee Calculation:**  
   Based on the time a car stays in the parking area, the system will automatically calculate the parking cost.

4. **Search Vehicle Option:**  
   The user can search by car number to check whether the vehicle is currently parked or has already left.

### **4. Tools and Language**

- **Programming Language:** C  
  The complete program will be written using the C programming language.

- **Development Environment:** Code::Blocks  
  Code::Blocks will be used to write, compile, and run the program.

- **Database Method:** File Handling  
  Files will be used to store parking information such as car number, entry time, exit time, and parking cost.

### **5. Expected Outcome**

After completing this project, we will have a simple and user-friendly system that helps manage a parking area efficiently. It will reduce manual work, save time, and maintain accurate records. The system will be useful for schools, offices, and small parking areas.
